// Default videos should be in 16:9 aspect ratio.

// Default images in photos will be in an aspect ratio of 2:1 (2x height = 1xwidth, sample images are 600x300)

*// if the aspect ratio is not followed, the program will stretch the image for you.

// On program start, the computer will ALWAYS use the default sample images. You can change this in the default folder. (sample-1.png to sample-4.png, SMPI.mov) Make sure they would be of the same name

// Just drop the image you want, regardless of name for it to flash in  the program.
