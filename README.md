### A queueing system made with socket.io and electron.

## About:
This is a small project for myself to learn **socket.io**, **electron**, and other **Node.js** stuff and at the same time to practice coding. The project runs as intended and binaries are not included (they are ~200MB in size!).

The project was also issued by a client, namely a local pawnshop that wanted a queueing system, which is why the graphics are so.

If you wish to help me improve my spaghetti code, feel free to fork and/or contribute to my code! Thanks!
